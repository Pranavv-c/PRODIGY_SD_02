# Number Guessing Game  

## Project Overview  
A fun and interactive **Number Guessing Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a chosen difficulty range, while tracking attempts, time taken, and best score.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python Programming** → For Basic prototype  
- **HTML5** → Structure of the game interface
- **CSS3** → Styling, themes, and dark mode support  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** → Game logic, timer, scoreboard, and interactivity  
- **LocalStorage** → Persistent best score tracking  

---

## Features  
- **Difficulty Levels** → Easy (1–100), Medium (1–500), Hard (1–1000)  
- **Timer** → Tracks how long it takes to guess the number  
- **Scoreboard** → Saves best score across sessions using localStorage  
- **Themes & Dark Mode** → Switch between red, green, blue, or dark mode  
- **Restart Option** → Instantly restart with a new random number  
- **Validation** → Handles invalid inputs gracefully  

---

## Process  
- **Setup**: Designed the HTML structure for input, buttons, and scoreboard.  
- **Styling**: Applied CSS for layout, themes, and dark mode toggle.  
- **Game Logic**: Implemented JavaScript functions for:  
   - Random number generation  
   - Checking guesses (too high/low/correct)  
   - Timer functionality  
   - Scoreboard persistence with localStorage  
- **Enhancements**: Added difficulty levels, restart button, and theme selector for better user experience.

## What I Learned  
- How to use **JavaScript DOM manipulation** for dynamic updates.  
- Implementing **localStorage** for persistent data across sessions.  
- Designing **responsive UI/UX** with CSS transitions and themes.  
- Writing **clean, modular functions** for better readability and maintainability.  
- Importance of **user feedback** (e.g., validation messages, result display).  

---

## How It Could Be Improved  
- Add **sound effects** for correct/incorrect guesses.  
- Implement a **leaderboard system** with multiple players.  
- Add **hint system** (e.g., "close to the number").  
- Make the UI **mobile-responsive** with adaptive layouts.  
- Add **animations** for winning or restarting the game.  
- Expand difficulty with **custom ranges** chosen by the player.
